Hello friends, I'm Leonardo. I'm an electronic engineering. Through my last 4 years I got interested in programming languages and how to use these languages to build Applicationns and Web Pages. I am currently starting on my own web project with Django Framework(Backend Python), .NET Core 8 (Backend C#), Vue.js 3 (Frontend Typescript) and Quasar as CSS Frameworks.

Also I'm currently working on C#, ASP.NET languages and Typescript.
